# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for xt907 hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and xt907, hence its name.
#

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/full_base_telephony.mk)
# Inherit from xt907 device
$(call inherit-product, device/motorola/xt907/device.mk)

## Device identifier. This must come after all inclusions
PRODUCT_DEVICE := xt907
PRODUCT_NAME := full_xt907
PRODUCT_BRAND := motorola
